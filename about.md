## Tech Interests

As a generalist I find myself dabbling across the board, but lately I've been interested in reliability engineering as well as serverless technologies. Topics such as observability of distributed / microservices, running at scale with minimal manual ops, continuous deployment and DevSecOps have been peeking my interest. And of course, all things open source!

## Personal Interests

When I'm not spending time with my family, I'm obsessed with fly fishing and exploring the outdoors. Summer weekends filled with hiking, camping and mountain biking sound perfect to me.
